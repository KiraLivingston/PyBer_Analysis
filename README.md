# PyBer_Analysis
## Pyber Analysis Overview
The purpose of the analysis challenge is to determine the total number of rides, total number of drivers, and the total fares for each city type. Then calculate the average fair per ride and average fair per driver for each city type and show with line graph.

## Results

By analyzing costs, riders in rural cities pay almost $10 more than riders in urban cities. The average fare per ride is approximately $35 in rural cities whereas the average fare per ride is approximately $25 in urban cities. Suburban cities average fare per ride is approximately $31.
  The average fare per driver is approximately $55 in rural cities. The average fare per driver in urban cities is about $17 while the average fare per driver in suburban cities is approximately $40.
    By comparing the cost analysis it seems that drivers in rural cities make the most fare per driver while the riders in urban cities pay the least amount in fare per rider.
##Summary
Three recommendations to address differences between city types would be:
1. Charge per mileage so that all riders are paying a fare price per ride.
2. Pay drivers same rate per city type.
3. Rotate drivers in each city type so that the drivers share each type of work load.  The drivers may then feel a sense of fairness.
